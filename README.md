## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

### **Login Section**
- When you serve the application, the first page you will see is the **Login Page**.
- Enter your email and password to log in, and you will be redirected to the **Dashboard**.
- If there are any errors, they will be displayed below the input fields.



### **Chat Bot Section**
- This section features a simple **Chat Bot** with predefined keys and responses.  
- When you send a message using one of the predefined keys, the bot instantly responds with the corresponding predefined reply.
